# Project Title: PetSpotters
Developers: Elaine Bergstrom & Malin Goethe

## Description

 We wanted to create a website using React and Redux that allowed users to post for lost or found pets in their area. Basically a digital version of putting up lost posters but on the internet. We wanted users to be able to search for animals they had lost, post lost pets, or post pets they had found with no owner.
